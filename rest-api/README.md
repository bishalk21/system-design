## API

- Application Programming Interface.
- a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
- An API defines the way that different software components should interact with each other.

## sending or posting data using rest.http

- need to send data as object as json file
- need to specify what type of data are we sending by sending HEADER - `Content-Type: application/json`

## HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol.

- client sends request to the server and waits for the response from it.
  The request contains information about the method used, the URL of the resource, and the version of HTTP being used. The server responds with the status of the request and the requested resource.
- Request Methods : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD

## What is REST API?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and Web Services (SOAP, WSDL, etc).

### Architectural Constraints

User ---- UI/Frontend ---- Server

1. 1-tier architecture (Monolithic)

User ----- [UI/Frontend + Server]

2. 2-tier architecture (Client-Server)

User ----- [UI/Frontend] <--- (REST API) ---> [Server/backend]

3. 3-tier architecture

User ----- [UI/Frontend] <--- (REST API) ---> [Server/backend] <--- (REST API) ---> [Database]

### REST API

REST API is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of the rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.

- A style of building web applications and APIs that focuses on interactivity and simplicity.
- REST APIs are stateless, meaning that calls can be made independently of one another, and each call contains all of the data needed to complete itself successfully.
- REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
- REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and the server.
- REST APIs are driven by hypermedia links that are contained in the representation. This means that the client interacts with the server by exchanging representations of resources.
- The main constraints for designing RESTful systems
  - Client-Server:
    - The client and the server are separate entities that interact with each other through a well-defined interface. The client is responsible for the user interface and the server is responsible for the data storage and processing.
    - The client handles the UI and user interaction, while the server handles the data storage and processing, business logic. This separation of concerns allows for better scalability and flexibility in the design of the system.
  - Stateless:
    - Each request from the client to the server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client. The server does not store any information about the client between requests. This means that each request is independent of any previous requests, and the server does not need to maintain any state information about the client.
    - Each API request should include authentication tokens if required. The server should not rely on any previous requests to authenticate the client. This makes systems easier to scale and maintain, as the server does not need to keep track of any client state.
  - Cacheable:
    - Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests. Caching can improve performance by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the server, and can also reduce the load on the server by allowing clients to reuse previously retrieved data.
    - Caching can be implemented using HTTP headers such as `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, and `ETag`. These headers allow the server to specify how long a response can be cached, and under what conditions it can be reused.
    - Caching leads to faster (performance) response times and reduced server load, as clients can retrieve data from their local cache instead of making a new request to the server.
    - Caching can be implemented at various levels, including the client, server, and intermediary caches (such as proxies and CDNs).
  - Layered System:
    - A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load-balancing and by providing shared caches. They may also enforce security policies.
    - The layered system constraint allows for the use of intermediaries such as load balancers, proxies, and gateways, which can help to improve scalability, security, and performance of the system.
  - Uniform Interface:
    - The uniform interface constraint is a fundamental principle of REST that defines a standardized way for clients and servers to communicate with each other. It consists of four sub-constraints:
      1. Resource Identification: Resources are identified in requests using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). This allows clients to access and manipulate resources using a consistent and predictable URL structure.
      2. Resource Manipulation through Representations: Clients interact with resources by exchanging representations of those resources. A representation is a specific format (such as JSON or XML) that contains the data and metadata of the resource. This allows clients to manipulate resources by sending representations to the server.
      3. Self-descriptive Messages: Each message (request or response) contains all the information needed to understand and process the message. This means that messages should include appropriate headers, status codes, and body content to convey the necessary information about the request or response.
      4. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): Clients interact with the application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. This means that clients can discover available actions and navigate through the application by following links provided in the responses from the server.
  - Code on Demand (optional)

#### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

- REST APIs use HTTP methods to perform different operations. The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

## Why REST API?

- easy to build and understand.
- REST API is stateless, meaning that calls can be made independently of one another, and each call contains all of the data needed to complete itself successfully.
- flexible: can be used with any programming language.
- Scalable: can be used with any type of application.
- flexibility with data: can be used with any type of data (json, xml, etc).
- Uniform interface: REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and the server. This means that clients don't need to know anything about the server, and servers don't need to know anything about the client.
- statelessness: each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.
- caching: responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests.
- separation of concerns: client and server are independent of each other, and can evolve separately without any dependency on each other.
- interoperability (language agnostic):
- security: REST APIs can be secured using HTTPS, which encrypts the data being sent between the client and the server.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator) parts

`https://www.example.com/forum/questions?tag=networking&order=newest#top`

- `https` - protocol, scheme
- `www.example.com` - domain name, hostname
  - `www` - subdomain
  - `example` - second-level domain
  - `com` - top-level domain (TLD)
- `/forum/questions` - path
  - `/forum` - directory
  - `/questions` - file
- `?tag=networking&order=newest` - query string
  - `tag=networking` - key-value pair (parameter)
  - `order=newest` - key-value pair (parameter)
- `#top` - fragment identifier

### HTTP Methods

### CRUD Operations

| Operation | Description                 | HTTP Method |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Create    | Create a new resource       | POST        |
| Read      | Read a resource             | GET         |
| Update    | Update an existing resource | PUT/PATCH   |
| Delete    | Delete a resource           | DELETE      |
| HEAD      | Get metadata of a resource  | HEAD        |
| OPTIONS   | Get allowed methods         | OPTIONS     |
| CONNECT   | Connect to a server         | CONNECT     |
| TRACE     | Trace a request             | TRACE       |

**PUT/PATCH** - PUT is used to update the entire resource, while PATCH is used to update part of the resource.

### Headers

- Headers are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request or response.

### Request

### Response

### Status Codes

- Status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate the status of the HTTP response.

- Why Status code is important?
  - Status codes provide information about the status of the request.
  - Status codes help to debug issues with the request.
  - Status codes help to understand the response from the server.
  - Status codes help to handle errors and exceptions.

| Status Range | Use Case      | Status codes | Description                                                  |
